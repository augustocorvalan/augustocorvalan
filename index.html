			<h1 class="name">Augusto Corvalan</h1>

			<p>I work at the intersection of tech, art, design and community.</p>

			<p>I spend a lot of time collaborating with artists to explore future modes of storytelling. I am the creator of <a href="https://deadalivemagazine.com/">DEAD ALIVE MAGAZINE</a>.</p>

			<p>I have worked as a professional front-end developer since 2013--<a href="coding.html">more about my work here</a>.</p>


			<br />
			<p>I've tried switching to tea but espresso will always have my heart.</p>
			<p>I used to split my time between creative writing and coding. <a href="writing.html">These days I combine the two.</a> I keep a blog of electronic literature techniques <a href="blog/finding-cross-textual-connections-using-markov.html">HERE</a>.</p> 
			<br />

			<p>Currently pursuing an MFA in Studio Art at <a href="https://www.mica.edu/">Maryland College Institute of Art</a>. I get my hands dirty with <a href="visual-art.html">printmaking, graphic design and public art.</a></p>


			<p>I am also a <a href="https://www.columbia.edu/">Columbia University</a> alum, where I studied computer science with a focus on <a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Social-Network-Analysis-of-Alice-in-Wonderland-Agarwal-Corvalan/845c095b679e75f5f7d299935407ea89313741f2?citingPapersSort=is-influential#citing-papers">natural language processing and literature.</a></p>

			<p>For coding I prefer upbeat dance music. For creative writing I find silence is best.</p>
