		<h1>No Stop City Remix</h1>
		<h2>Generative Experimental Architecture in CAD and VR</h2>
		<h4>03.2020</h4>

		<h5>Motivation</h5>

		<p><i>"I learned to see freedom as always and intimately linked to the issue of transforming space" --bell hooks</i></p>

		<p>This project is the beginning of a speculative exploration into experimental and possibly impossible forms of architecture and space creation. We will use Python to create generative models that we can then turn into CAD for 3-D printing and HTML for WebVR.</p>

		<h5>No-Stop City</h5>

		<p>I wanted to start by recreating a base case, in this case Archizoom Associati's No-Stop City project of 1966-72. No-Stop City consists of plans and drawings of an endless grid of structures that would span the whole world. "The metropolis ceases to be a 'place,' to become a 'condition'" (Varnelis, 87).</p>

		<p>No-Stop City describes "an amoral city, a city without qualities...instead of denying this logic [of maximum quantity], we decided to make use of its inner workings to achieve a demystification of all its ideals" (Varnelis, 87). That is, by co-opting the logic of the capitalist superstructure (supermarkets, factories) and extending it to its maximum logical conclusion, No-Stop City paradoxically describes a system where the individual can achieve psychomotor creative freedom.</p>

		<p>The aim is to take a closer look at this radical practice from the past and see how it can inform responses to contemporary challenges. We will first create a Python script that will give us a model describing our own No-Stop City. This model can then be converted into different output formats. This way we can instantiate the model in different formats without having to rewrite our underlying logic.</p>
